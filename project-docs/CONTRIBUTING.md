# Contributing to [FIXME PROJECT]

Contributions can come in many forms, we always need help in improving the project. If you find issues with the documentation, usability, code, or even a question, please open an [issue](FIXME PROJECT ISSUES PAGE) to let us know and or post in [Builtree Discord Server](FIXME discord server link)'s relevant channel.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Make sure there is an issue existing for your pull request. If not, get in touch with a maintainer/mentor and create one.
2. Make sure that issue has been acknowledged by the maintainer/mentor before you start working.
3. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
4. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests (if the project supports tests or has a testing guideline). Ensure the test suite passes.
5. If you've changed a feature,API,etc., update the documentation.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Properly attach that pull request to its issue!

## Any contributions you make will be under the [FIXME] License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [FIXME License](FIXME license link) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](FIXME link)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](FIXME link); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail
Make sure the bug reports are detaild and follow the bug issue template in the project.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports!
